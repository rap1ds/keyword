# Keyword

A Keyword-driven testing library for node.

The library allows you to write low-level keywords that can be used for integration testing. By combining the low-level keywords, you can create new high-level keywords without writing any code. Low-level keyword maps to a JavaScript function, where as high-level keyword contains only other high or low-level keywords.

## Hello World example

Let's write the first low-level keywords `Hello World`, which prints, "Hello World" and `How are you?` which prints "How are you?", obviously.

```javascript
// lowlevel-keywords.js

var lowlevelKeywords = {
    "Hello World": function(next) {
        console.log("Hello World");
        next();
    },
    "How are you?": function(next) {
        console.log("How are you?");
        next();
    }
};

module.exports = lowlevelKeywords;
```

Pretty simple stuff. Now, we can create a suite of high-level keywords.

Let's create our first high-level keyword `Greet the World`, which says hello and asks how it is going. High-level keywords can be are defined as plain JavaScript object.

```javascript
// highlevel-keywords.js

var highlevelKeywords = {
    "Greet the World": [
        "Hello World",
        "How are you?"
    ]
};

module.exports = highlevelKeywords;
```

Next, we want to run our keywords. Here's the code that runs the keyword `Greet the World`:

```javascript
// basic-example.js

// Require keyword library
var key = require('keyword');
var _ = require('underscore');

// Import keyword definitions
_.forEach(require('./lowlevel-keywords'), function(fn, name) {
    key(name, fn);
});
key.suite(require('./highlevel-keywords'));

key.run("Greet the World").then(function() {
    // All done.
});
```

Now we can run the example by typing

```bash
$ node basic-example.js
```

Output

```bash
> Hello World
> How are you?
```

## Keywords with params and return values

In basic example, all the keyword were static. They didn't take any parameter nor did they return anything.

Both, low-level and high-level keywords can take parameters and return values.

Let's define three low-level keyword: 

* `Print` takes `message` as a parameter and prints it to the console log. 
* `Hello` takes `name` and returns a string saying "Hello" to that person.
* `Join` takes two strings and joins them into one string, separating by a newline

```javascript
// lowlevel-keywords.js

var lowlevelKeywords = {
    "Print": function(next, message) {
        console.log(message);
        next();
    },
    "Hello": function(next, name) {
        var returnValue = "Hello " + name;
        next(returnValue);
    },
    "Join": function(next, str1, str2) {
        var returnValue = [str1, str2].join("\n");
        next(returnValue);
    }
};

module.exports = lowlevelKeywords;
```

Alright! Our low-level keywords look a lot more general compared to the keywords in the basic example!

Now let's create some high-level keywords that give parameters to the low-level keywords, saves the return value and return something themselves. `Greet Mikko` generates a greeting message for `Mikko`.

```javascript
// high-level-keywords.js

var highlevelKeywords = {
    "Create a greeting": [
        "Hello", ["$1"], "=> $helloMikko",
        "Join", ["$helloMikko", "How are you?"], "=> $return"
    ],
    "Greet Mikko": [
        "Create a greeting", ["Mikko"], "=> $greeting",
        "Print", "$greeting"
    ]
};

module.exports = highlevelKeywords;
```

And then the `runner.js` file, which is mostly the same as in the previous example

```javascript
// keywords-with-parameters-example.js

// Require keyword library
var key = require('keyword');
var _ = require('underscore');

// Import keyword definitions
_.forEach(require('./lowlevel-keywords'), function(fn, name) {
    key(name, fn);
});
key.suite(require('./highlevel-keywords'));

key.run("Greet Mikko").then(function() {
    // All done.
});
```

Now we can run the example by typing

```bash
$ node keywords-with-parameters-example.js
```

Output

```bash
> Hello Mikko
> How are you?
```

## How does this relate to testing??

Ok, now you've seen how to define and use keywords, but I bet you're eager to know how does this make integration testing awesome!

Web application integration testing is usually done by threating the application as a black box which you interact through the browser. The test cases for integration tests contain a lot of repeating tasks, such as clicking an element or filling in a form, etc. These repearing tasks can be defined as a general purpose low-level keywords, such as `Click`, `Fill Input`, `Navigate To URL`, etc.

Imaging you're testing a social media application. Your task is to test sending message from a user Jane to user David.

First thing you have to do is to login as a Jane. This can be done by navigation to the login page (using `Navigate To URL`). Then you have to fill in user credentials (using `Fill Input`) and click login button (`Click`). And all these you can combine and create a new high-level keyword, `Login as`.

After that you'll do the messaging stuff, but then you need to assert that David really got the message. So how would you do that? Well, you can use the `Login as` keyword to login with David's account and see if the message arrived!

I bet you can already see the point of keywords. By defining general purpose low-level keywords, you can easily combine them and create complex high-level keywords that will make your integration testing awesome!

## How to interact with the browser?

The library doesn't care how you interact with the browser and what is the browser you're using. You can use for example Zombie, but my favorite is to use PhantomJS via Node WebDriver.

See the Google Search example for PhantomJS via WebDriver

## Getting Started

```javascript
// Define your keywords and test cases in JSON format

var suite = {

    /***** The main test case *****/
    "Test Google Search": [
        "Google Search For", ["keyword driven testing"], "=> $searchResult",
        "Should Equal", ["$searchResult", "Keyword-driven testing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"]
    ],

    /***** Define keywords ******/
    "Google Search For": [
        "Go To Page", ["http://google.com"],
        "Fill Input By Name", ["q", "$1"],
        "Click Element By Name", ["btnG"],
        "Pick First Search Result", "=> $return"
    ],

    "Pick First Search Result": [
        "Get Text Content Of First Tag", ["h3"], "=> $return"
    ]
}

// Implement your low-level keywords

// This example uses WebDriver and PhantomJS
var webdriver = require('selenium-node-webdriver');

var key = requre('keyword');
var assert = require('assert');

var session = webdriver();

key("Go To Page", function(next, url) {
    session.then(function(driver) {
        console.log("Going to", url);
        return driver.get(url);
    }).done(next);
});

key("Fill Input By Name", function(next, elementName, text) {
    session.then(function(driver) {
        return driver.
            findElement(driver.webdriver.By.name(elementName)).
            sendKeys(text);
    }).done(next);
});

key("Click Element By Name", function(next, elementName) {
    session.then(function(driver) {
        return driver.
            findElement(driver.webdriver.By.name(elementName)).click();
    }).done(next);
});

key("Get Text Content Of First Tag", function(next, elementTagName) {
    session.then(function(driver) {
        return driver.executeScript(function(tag) {
            // This script is run in browser context
            return document.querySelector('h3.r').textContent;
        }, elementTagName)
        .then(function(firstHit) {
            console.log("The first Google hit:", firstHit);
            return firstHit;
        });
    }).done(next);
});

key("Should Equal", function(next, a, b) {
    console.log("Should Equal: '" + a + "' and '" + b + "'");
    assert(a === b);
    next();
});

// Load the keywords
key.suite(suite);

console.log();

// Run the keyword
key.run("Test Google Search").then(function() {
    console.log("\nDone.\n")
    session.then(function(driver) {
        driver.quit();
    })
});
```
